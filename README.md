# 🏠 SmartRealty AI — A Geo-Intelligent House Price Prediction System

🌐 **geo-estate-intelligence-system**  
👉 https://your-app-link.streamlit.app  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Real estate pricing is highly dependent on **location, infrastructure, and accessibility**.

This project builds a **production-ready AI system** that predicts property prices using:

- 🧠 Machine Learning (XGBoost)
- 🗺️ Real-time Geo Intelligence (OpenStreetMap)
- 🎯 Explainable AI (SHAP)
- 📍 Interactive Map-based UI

👉 Unlike traditional models, this system uses **live infrastructure data** (metro, hospitals, schools, etc.) instead of static features.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> Can we predict real estate prices dynamically using location intelligence and surrounding infrastructure?

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Predict house prices accurately  
- Incorporate **real-world geo features**  
- Provide **human-readable explanations**  
- Build an **interactive product (not just a model)**  

---

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🖱️ 1. Click-on-Map Prediction
- Select any location on map  
- Fetch real-time geo data  
- Predict price instantly  

---

### 🗺️ 2. Geo Intelligence Engine
Uses OpenStreetMap to compute:

- 🚇 Distance to Metro  
- 🏥 Hospitals  
- 🏫 Schools  
- 🎓 Colleges  
- 🚌 Bus Stops  
- 🚆 Railway Stations  
- 🚓 Police Stations  

---

### 📊 3. Price Heatmap
- Visualizes pricing patterns across regions  
- Helps identify high/low value zones  

---

### 🤖 4. Smart Recommendation Engine
- Suggests similar properties  
- Based on:
  - Price  
  - Area  
  - Location score  
  - Livability  

---

### 🎯 5. Explainable AI (SHAP)
- Shows **why** a price was predicted  
- Example:
sqft increased price by ₹X
location_score increased price by ₹Y


---

## 📊 Dataset & Pipeline

### 🔄 Data Flow
Web Scraping → Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Database → Model → UI


---

### 🧹 Data Processing

✔ Price normalization (Lac/Cr → numeric)  
✔ Area extraction (sqft)  
✔ Location parsing  
✔ Feature engineering  

---

### ⚙️ Features Used

- sqft  
- location_score  
- livability_score  
- infrastructure distances  
- price_per_sqft  

---

## 🤖 Model Development

### Models Considered

- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost ✅ (Final Model)

---

### 🏆 Final Model: XGBoost

**Why?**

- Handles non-linearity  
- Works well on structured data  
- High performance  

---

### 📈 Performance

- R² Score: ~0.93  
- Strong generalization  

---

## 🔍 Explainability

Using SHAP:

- Global feature importance  
- Local prediction explanation  
- Human-readable outputs  

---

## 🧠 Geo Intelligence (Key Innovation)

Instead of static features:

Location → Coordinates → OSM → Real distances → Model input

## 🖥️ Application UI

Built with Streamlit:

Interactive sliders
Map-based input
Heatmaps
Recommendations
Explainability panel

## 💼 Recruiter Note

### 🧠 Why My application is actually different (and useful)

#### 🔥 1) Context-aware pricing (not just listings)

╰┈➤ Most platforms show:

Past listings + average prices

╰┈➤ MY app does:

Location → live infrastructure → model → price

👉 Value:

Works for new/under-construction areas with sparse comps
Adapts when new metro lines / hospitals appear

#### 🗺️ 2) Click-anywhere prediction (zero listing dependency)

╰┈➤ Others:

You must search an existing listing

╰┈➤ Me:

Click any point on the map → get a price

👉 Value:

Investors can scout undeveloped pockets
Users can compare micro-locations (same locality, different streets)

#### ⚙️ 3) Real-time geo intelligence (not static labels)

╰┈➤ Others:

“Near metro” as a tag (often binary / outdated)

╰┈➤ Me:

Actual distances to:
metro, schools, hospitals, police, etc.

👉 Value:

Fine-grained differentiation:
300m vs 2km from metro ≠ same price impact

#### 🎯 4) Explainable pricing (trust layer)

╰┈➤ Others:

Black box: “₹X — take it or leave it”

╰┈➤ Me:

- Why this price?
- sqft added ₹…
- location_score added ₹…
- distances impacted ₹…

👉 Value:

- Builds trust
- Useful for:
    - buyers (negotiation)
    - sellers (pricing strategy)

#### 🤖 5) Smart recommendations (not ads)

╰┈➤ Others:

Sponsored listings / basic filters

╰┈➤ Me:

Similarity-based recommendations
price + area + livability + location

👉 Value:

Actually answers: “what else should I consider?”
